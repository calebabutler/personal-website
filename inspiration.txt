I enjoy that there is high information density, but it is also aesthetically
pleasing. Technologies I plan to use:
- Cloudflare pages for hosting
- React and Typescript
- React Bootstrap for simple components
- React-markdown for translating markdown into my website
- React-router for multiple pages

Opinions on technology. Support for:
- The public interest internet: https://www.eff.org/issues/public-interest-internet
- The Fediverse
- PGP email encryption
- Self-hosting
