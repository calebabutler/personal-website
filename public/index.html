    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I live with my wife, Carla, and our two cats, Blue and Walnut.</p>

    <p>Blue loves to sleep and eat wet cat food. He loves all wet food and asks for it at all hours of the day. He is very talkative and likes to stick his tongue out.</p>

    <p>Walnut loves to jump onto people when they least expect it. She likes being held and petted, and she will scratch you if you do not pet her. She is very playful.</p>

    <p>They both love cat treats.</p>
